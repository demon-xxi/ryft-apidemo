<p>In order to achieve high speed processing, all input and output files that are used by ROL primitives must be located in the TFS file system. The TFS file system is a proprietary Linux file system located at an appropriate mount point, which you can browse on the window above.</p>
<p>Once data has been loaded onto the TFS file system UPs can be executed to analyze, modify, or reduce the data using primitive operations. Each UP processes a set of input files, and produces a single output file containing the resultant data.</p>
