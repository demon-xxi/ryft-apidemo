<p>The query string of a Fuzzy search follows the same format as a regular search. The fuzziness parameter allows the specification of a "close enough"" value to indicate how close the input must be to the query string. 
Specifically, "close enough"" is specified by a Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. To put it another way, Hamming distance measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.</p>
